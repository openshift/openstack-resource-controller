# openstack-resource-controller

_Deploy your OpenStack resources in a declarative way, using Kubernetes._

[**openstack-resource-controller**][orc], or **ORC**, brings Resource Definitions and controllers to let you `kubectl apply` your OpenStack resources, like networks and servers, to multiple OpenStack clouds at once.

ORC is based on [Gophercloud][gophercloud], the OpenStack Go SDK.
