    # This file handle Glance image upload in CAPO.
    # This code intentionally supports insecure hash algorithms, because for public images the consumer can't, in practise,
    # influence the hash algorithm presented. If the only published hash is MD5 it's more secure to check it than not
    # check it, so we support MD5.
    # Incidentally, Glance only directly supports SHA512. This is wildly impractical as almost nobody publishes this:
    # SHA256 is most common in practise. Also Glance publishes a hash of something that isn't guaranteed to be what it downloaded.
    # Also there's no way to determine via the API if it's going to do this. Glance hash verification is unusable.
